# Turtle Race Game
# Overview
The Turtle Race Game is a fun and interactive program where users can bet on which turtle will win a race. This program uses Python's turtle module to create a graphical race simulation. Players choose a turtle by its color and watch the race unfold to see if their chosen turtle wins.

# Features
Graphical user interface using the turtle module.
Five different turtles with unique colors.
User input to place a bet on which turtle will win.
Randomized movement to simulate the race.
Announcer to declare the result of the race.
# Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. The code uses the built-in turtle module, so no additional installations are required.

# How to Run
Clone the Repository: https://github.com/ananya-kushi07/Turtle-race.git

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>

Run the Program:
python turtle_race.py

A prompt will appear asking you to enter the color of the turtle you think will win. Enter one of the following colors: red, yellow, white, blue, green.
Watch the Race:

The turtles will start moving across the screen. The first turtle to reach the right edge of the screen wins.
Check the Result:

If the turtle you bet on wins, the screen will display "You won".
If another turtle wins, the screen will display "You lost".
# Conclusion
The Turtle Race Game is an entertaining way to practice Python programming with the turtle module. By following this guide, you can set up and run the game, placing bets and enjoying the excitement of the race!
